### Virginia Slave Draft
- **Legal codification of slavery in Virginia (1630s–1680s):**  
  - Virginia was among the first colonies to establish laws transforming African captives into *chattel slaves*, passing statutes that defined slavery as inheritable (from parent to child).  
  - Enslaved Africans who converted to Christianity were denied equal freedoms with white Christians, showing that *race-based slavery* took precedence over religion.  
  - Early cases, such as the 1630 punishment of Hugh Davis for “lying with a negro,” reveal how colonial law linked slavery, interracial relations, and morality.

- **Moral and religious justification:**  
  - Massachusetts Bay Puritans authorized enslavement of “Captives taken in just warres” and strangers sold as slaves, reflecting how slavery was framed within *Christian justifications*.  
  - Slave codes required masters to treat slavery as a biblical institution, enforcing a Christianized rationale for bondage.  

- **Expansion and regulation of slave laws:**  
  - Over time, slavery required increasingly complex laws governing not only enslaved people but also white colonists’ behavior.  
  - Codes enforced discipline through measures such as banning interracial marriage, prohibiting whites from aiding runaway slaves, and requiring slave owners to provide food/clothing.  
  - Legal codes gave masters *almost unlimited disciplinary power* over enslaved people, legitimizing systemic violence.  

- **Global and transatlantic connections:**  
  - English colonial codes paralleled France’s *Code Noir (Black Code)*, reflecting a broader *Atlantic World pattern* of codifying slavery across European empires.  
  - The transatlantic slave trade fed into these legal systems, as enslaved Africans were forcibly transported and commodified across colonies.  
  - Global opinion was not yet abolitionist; slavery was accepted across European colonies (English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese), though dissenting religious groups (Quakers, some evangelicals) would begin to challenge it later in the 17th–18th centuries.  

- **Controversy and historical interpretation:**  
  - Determining the *legal status of blacks in early Virginia remains controversial*, since formal laws regulating slavery only appear decades after Africans’ arrival (1619 vs. codification in 1660s).  
  - Early prosecutions in the 1630s–1640s suggest Africans lacked equal justice before the law, while statutes from the 1660s onward became explicitly race-based and discriminatory.  
  - Historians argue that the emergence of *racial prejudice in legal statutes* was crucial to entrenching slavery as a permanent institution in America.  
- 1630: Hugh Davis punished (whipped) for having relations with a Black woman → early example of laws punishing interracial sex.

- 1640: Robert Sweat case → Black woman servant punished for bearing his child; Sweat ordered to do public penance.

- 1662: Law established that children’s status (slave/free) followed the condition of the mother → key shift cementing hereditary slavery.

- 1667: Baptism did not change enslaved status → Christianity no longer a path to freedom.

- 1668: Freed Black women still required to pay taxes (unlike white women) → partial freedoms denied.

- 1669: Masters not guilty of felony if a slave dies during punishment → legalized extreme violence, removed accountability.

- 1670 (June): Free Blacks and Indians barred from owning Christian servants, though allowed to buy enslaved people of their own race → reinforced racial hierarchy.
