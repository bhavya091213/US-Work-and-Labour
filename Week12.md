# Week 12 Notes


## **Source 1: *Who Built America*, Chapter 9**



### **1. Southern Society & Slave Dependence**

* Southern wealth and social order were **“built on the backs”** of enslaved labor (p. 427).
* Planters competed for **land, slaves, and political power**, creating constant tension.
* White non-slaveholding farmers still supported slavery because it preserved **racial hierarchy**.

### **2. Household Control & Gender**

* Mistresses faced “**sexual competition**” from enslaved women; husbands’ infidelity was common.
* Catherine Hammond example: forced to manage plantation while pregnant **seven times in nine years**.
* WBA notes wives were expected to **ignore sexual abuse** because “a proper lady would, of course, try to ignore” this.

### **3. Planters’ Paternalism**

* Masters claimed their authority over slaves was simply an extension of their power over family.
* Quote: “**The master’s power over his slaves was merely an extension of his power over his wife and children**.”
* Paternalism reinforced **strict hierarchy** in the home and workplace.

### **4. Violence & Discipline**

* A Charleston enslaved woman had **“deeply lacerated back”** from whippings (p. 427).
* Owners placed an **iron collar with three prongs** around her neck to prevent escape.
* Shows brutality hidden behind paternalist rhetoric.

### **5. Conflicts Over Texas & Expansion**

* Texas symbolized planter ambition: “**ability to expand slavery and consolidate power**” (p. 429).
* Mexico outlawed slavery → tensions with U.S. slaveholding migrants.
* U.S.–Mexican conflict partly driven by desire to **extend slave territory**.

### **6. Panic of 1837 & Elite Planter Growth**

* Economic depression destroys small farms, but wealthy planters buy up land at cheap prices.
* Cotton price “**soared again**” in 1840s, restoring planter profits (p. 431).
* Result: a **shrinking but richer** planter elite.

### **7. Plantation Lifestyle & Wealth Display**

* New mansions built in the Delta with “**fine wines, fancy clothes… domestic labor force large enough to care for the new amenities**.”
* Shows how slavery funded conspicuous consumption.

### **8. Overseers as Violent Enforcers**

* Overseers recognized by slaves as “**weak link in the chain of command**” (p. 435).
* Many were “**interested more in sexual exploitation** than in production.”

### **9. Slave Religion & Secret Worship**

* Quote (from enslaved man): “**They preached, ‘Obey your master,’ but we had another meeting at night…**”
* Religion allowed enslaved people to build community, hope, and resistance.
* Planters tried pushing obedience, but slaves reinterpreted Scripture.

### **10. African, Indian & Black Resistance**

* Seminole Wars: Africans + Seminoles fought U.S. Army for years (pp. 433–435).
* Joseph Cinqué example symbolizes courage and leadership.
* Resistance included **arson, escape, livestock destruction, and sabotage**.

### **11. Free Blacks Threatened Planter Control**

* Free Blacks showed Black autonomy; therefore states restricted movement, labor, and rights.
* Example: Virginia required special documentation; Mississippi banned migration of free Blacks.

### **12. Westward Expansion & Intensifying Sectionalism**

* Southern states wanted new territories because land exhaustion required new soil.
* Result: conflicts with Mexico, Native nations, and Northern politicians.
