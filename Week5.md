### Georgetwon Washington Post Article

* Hawkins’s grave was located in **Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic cemetery**, with his marker reading: *“Neely Hawkins, Died April 16, 1902.”*
### Georgetown Students Vote to Pay Reparations for University Sale of Slaves
- In April 2019, Georgetown undergraduates voted overwhelmingly to create a reparations fund to benefit descendants of the 272 enslaved people sold in 1838 by Jesuits tied to the university.  
- If approved by Georgetown’s governing board, this would be **the first reparations fund for slavery** by a major U.S. institution.  
- The fund was to be supported via a student‐imposed fee, generating roughly **$400,000 annually**.  
- The student referendum was **nonbinding**—the university later proposed voluntary donations rather than mandatory assessments.  
- Critics argue that shifting from a mandatory fee to voluntary giving weakens accountability and avoids direct responsibility.  
- The vote is emblematic of a broader reckoning by universities over historical ties to slavery and structural racial inequities.  
- Craig Steven Wilder, historian, said: *“The story of the American college is largely the story of the rise of the slave economy in the Atlantic world.”*  
- The “Challenges of Reconciliation and Reparations” article highlights tension between symbolic gestures and structural change.  
- Georgetown’s decision to opt for voluntary contributions rather than mandatory student fees drew criticism as insufficient.  
- The debate raises questions: who bears the cost, and are institutions truly owning up to their historical debts?  


### Slavery, Child-Family Separation, and the Catholic Church in the United States
- The Catholic Church in the U.S. historically depended on **slave labor and sales** to build institutions, including Georgetown University.  
- In the 1838 sale, children were routinely separated from parents—a recurring feature of the slave trade.  
- Rachel L. Swarns’s book *The 272* traces families over nearly two centuries of enslavement following that sale.  
- The blog and event raise questions: how did Church communities respond at the time, and how should they respond now?  
- The Jesuits, when forced to sell enslaved individuals, often chose to sell the people rather than land.  
- The Church’s justifications for child‐family separation historically often ignored or undermined African/Indigenous family structures and kinship systems.  
- **Peter Queen’s story**: he was sold by Jesuits against his will, escaped, was recaptured, and then sold farther from his family—his parents persistently petitioned for his return.  
- Despite the trauma, enslaved people and their descendants created extended and fictive kinship networks to preserve community ties.  
- The Church now is developing reparative and genealogical initiatives to help descendants recover histories and reconnect family networks.  
- A full reconciliation requires the Church to reexamine its theology, views of family, and institutional responsibilities in light of these histories.  


### The Case for Reparations (Reparations4Slavery)
- The reparations argument is framed as **straightforward**: descendants of enslaved people were dispossessed of labor, autonomy, and generational wealth.  
- The site provides historical context, including how whitewashed or erased narratives have obscured the case for redress.  
- It links the argument to **HR-40**, a proposed federal bill to study and eventually implement reparations nationally.  
- Offers a “roadmap” for using its portal: exploring institutional, municipal, and individual repair strategies.  
- Reparations4Slavery hosts tools and learning resources: genealogy guides, essays, historical timelines, and activism toolkits.  
- The portal’s mission emphasizes **repair, healing, and accountability**, not just symbolic gestures.  
- It situates the reparations discussion within **economic justice**, not only as a moral or symbolic act.  
- The site underscores that **repair requires both acknowledgment of harm and material restitution** (economic, social, structural).  
- It also frames reparations as a continuing process—not a one-time transaction.  
- The portal integrates storytelling and activism: descendant narratives, interviews, and projects are central to making the case more tangible.

- Emphasizes the difficulty of determining who would be eligible for compensation.  
- Suggests that waves of immigrants also faced discrimination, not just African Americans.  
- Frames slavery as a historical issue that the U.S. has already tried to atone for.

### Ta-Nehisi Coates, Danny Glover Testify at Congressional Hearing on Slavery Reparations
- Coates stresses slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration are interconnected eras, not separate events.  
- The deepest injury of slavery was the **ideology of Black inferiority**, which still persists.  
- Coates uses analogy: an injury (like a stabbing) leaves lasting complications even after the act ends—same with slavery’s legacy.  
- He calls on Congress to act on **HR 40**, a bill to study reparations and systemic racism.  
- Argues the U.S. must recognize both its achievements and its crimes (e.g., *“If D-Day matters, so does Black Wall Street”*).  
- Notes that discriminatory policies (GI Bill, Social Security, redlining, segregation) intentionally excluded Black Americans.  
- Danny Glover adds personal testimony, recalling displacement and gentrification in San Francisco.  
- Glover highlights mass incarceration and the crack epidemic as extensions of systemic oppression.  
- Both stress that reparations are about **truth-telling and accountability**, not just payments.  
- They frame reparations as essential to confronting the full history of American racism.

### Slavery to Mass Incarceration (Equal Justice Initiative)
- Traces slavery from its origins in **1619 Jamestown** to today’s racial inequities.  
- Enslavement evolved from indentured servitude into a **hereditary, race-based system**.  
- Millions of Africans were forcibly brought across the Atlantic; many died during the Middle Passage.  
- Enslaved people were denied legal rights, subjected to violence, forced family separations, and sexual exploitation.  
- The **Domestic Slave Trade** exploded after 1808, making cities like Montgomery major slave markets.  
- Families were systematically separated—nearly **half of enslaved people were separated** from spouses or parents.  
- After the Civil War, slavery transformed into **Jim Crow, racial terror, and lynchings**.  
- The Civil Rights Movement ended legal segregation, but racial bias persisted through housing, education, and policing.  
- Today, Black people are disproportionately criminalized: 1 in 3 Black males born today is expected to be incarcerated.  
- EJI argues mass incarceration and police violence are direct legacies of slavery, requiring national reckoning and truth-telling.
