# üìö US Work & Labor ‚Äî Source-by-Source Summaries (with connections)

---

## 1) U.S. Department of Labor (ILAB): **Child Labor in Bolivia**

**Full citation:** U.S. DOL, Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), *Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor ‚Äì Bolivia* (landing page and latest findings). ([DOL][1])

### Summary

* **Overall assessment & trend:** ILAB regularly evaluates Bolivia‚Äôs progress against the ‚Äúworst forms‚Äù of child labor (WFCL). Recent findings describe **mixed progress**‚Äîsome policy steps (e.g., bilateral cooperation against trafficking; specialized prosecutors; trainings) alongside **persistent, significant risks** for children in mining, agriculture, street work, and commercial sexual exploitation. ([DOL][1])
* **Sectors and hazards:** Children continue to work in **mining** (including dangerous underground work), **agriculture** (e.g., Brazil nuts), **domestic work**, **street vending**, and other informal services. Indigenous children are **disproportionately vulnerable**, and some forms rise to **forced labor** or trafficking. ([DOL][2])
* **Enforcement & gaps:** ILAB notes **legal and enforcement gaps**‚Äîuneven criminal enforcement transparency, limitations in the legal framework (e.g., military recruitment age issues), and inadequate resources to inspect and prevent WFCL. ([DOL][2])
* **Policy architecture:** Findings reference national plans and cooperation with regional and international bodies (e.g., UNODC trainings for specialized trafficking prosecutors), but emphasize that **implementation capacity** and **services for child victims** remain insufficient. ([ecoi.net][3])

### Connections to broader themes

* **Continuities of extraction:** Highlights how **resource-led economies** produce labor precarity that often pulls children into hazardous work‚Äî**a colonial-to-modern throughline** (see Las Casas/Potos√≠ below).
* **Law vs. lived reality:** Illustrates the common gap between **formal ratification/policy** and **on-the-ground enforcement**, a core question in labor history and policy.
* **Intersectionality:** Shows how **indigeneity, poverty, and informality** intersect to increase child-labor risk‚Äîkey to analyzing **who bears costs** in global commodity chains.

## 2) Texas Law (Human Rights Clinic): **‚ÄúChild Labor and the Mountain that Eats Men‚Äù**

**Full citation:** Sofia Bonilla, *Child Labor and the Mountain that Eats Men* (Texas Law Human Rights Project). ([Texas Law][4])

### Summary

* **Focus & frame:** A human-rights‚Äìoriented overview of **child labor in Cerro Rico (Potos√≠)** situating Bolivia within **global child-labor norms** (e.g., ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138). It argues that **cash-transfer‚Äìstyle fixes** are insufficient without **structural reforms** to dangerous, low-wage mining. ([Texas Law][4])
* **Conditions underground:** Describes **extreme hazards**‚Äîoxygen-poor shafts, collapses and explosions, long shifts, and **silicosis (‚Äúblack lung‚Äù)** drastically shortening life expectancy. Children sometimes **balance mining with school**, working pre-dawn to survive on **very low daily earnings**. ([Texas Law][4])
* **Poverty trap & cooperatives:** Explains the **poverty‚Äìwork‚Äìillness loop** around Cerro Rico: families rely on children‚Äôs wages; weak protections and cooperative structures keep risks on workers; **few exit paths** exist without robust social policy and education access. ([Texas Law][4])
* **Normative call:** Urges **governmental and policy changes** that go beyond stopgaps‚Äîtighten enforcement, expand education/health access, and address structural drivers that keep children in mines. ([Texas Law][5])

### Connections to broader themes

* **Extractive capitalism:** Makes explicit how **global demand for minerals** translates into **localized child risk**, echoing debates on **commodity chains** and **externalized costs**.
* **Human-rights governance:** Bridges **labor history** and **human-rights law**, showing how **international norms** (ILO conventions) interact with **domestic policy gaps**.
* **Reform vs. relief:** Invites analysis of **structural reforms** vs. **short-term relief**‚Äîa recurring tension in social policy.

## 3) **Bartolom√© de las Casas ‚Äî ‚ÄúVoices of Freedom‚Äù (image you attached)**

*(Context page introducing Las Casas; anthology framing; start of the 1500 narrative)*

### Summary (from the attached ‚ÄúVoices of Freedom‚Äù pages)

* **Who Las Casas is:** A Dominican friar known as the **‚ÄúApostle of the Indians,‚Äù** and a leading critic of **Spanish colonial brutality**‚Äîinitially complicit in exploitation, he later **freed his Native slaves** (1514) and wrote scathing denunciations (e.g., *History of the Indies*).
* **Core claims:** He **blames Spain** for the deaths and suffering of **millions** under systems of forced labor and conquest; advocates that Indigenous peoples deserve **rights equal to other Spanish subjects**; and his polemics feed the **‚ÄúBlack Legend‚Äù** (Spain cast as uniquely cruel), later instrumentalized by **rival empires**.
* **Policy impact:** His activism contributed to the **New Laws of 1542**, which sought to **end Indian enslavement** (though practical enforcement was contentious).
* **Narrative opening (1500):** The excerpt transitions to the Crown sending **Fray Nicol√°s de Ovando** as governor to Hispaniola‚Äîsetting the stage for the administrative intensification of colonial rule (and, implicitly, the labor regimes Las Casas condemns).

### Connections to broader themes

* **Witness as reformer:** Shows how **eyewitness moral critique** can shape imperial policy (New Laws), relevant to understanding **advocacy‚Äôs role** in labor reform.
* **Empire & ideology:** The **‚ÄúBlack Legend‚Äù** debate reminds us to scrutinize **how empires narrate each other**‚Äîuseful when reading polemical labor accounts.
* **Continuity to modern Bolivia:** Las Casas‚Äôs condemnation of **coerced Indigenous labor** prefigures modern concerns about **Indigenous child miners** in Potos√≠.

## 4) **Bartolom√© de las Casas ‚Äî ‚ÄúMonk page 7‚Äù (image you attached)**

*(A narrative page detailing mining/‚Äúminting‚Äù cycles and ‚Äúwages‚Äù)*

### Summary (from the attached page)

* **Mining cycle & devastation:** Describes **8-month mining ‚Äúshifts‚Äù** after which Indians walked **days home**‚Äîonly **\~10% survived** to even begin the return, due to overwork, disease, starvation, and accidents in the **gold/silver extraction** system.
* **Food & rations:** Workers subsisted on **cassava bread** with **tiny meat portions** (e.g., a pig stretched to **30‚Äì40 men** by stews), indicating **caloric deprivation** and deliberate **cost-minimizing rations** by overseers.
* **Tokenized wages:** The **comendador‚Äôs ‚Äúwage‚Äù scheme** paid in **maraved√≠s** at intervals with caps below a gold peso per year, plus trivial items (**comb, small mirror, glass beads**). In practice, this **non-remunerative ‚Äúpayment‚Äù** functioned as **coercion**‚Äîworkers remained **indebted** and trapped, working merely ‚Äúto appease raging hunger.‚Äù
* **Moral throughline:** The passage foregrounds **anguish, torments, and lack of rest**, showing that **familial obligations** (fields going to weeds, wives in distress) compounded the violence‚Äî**labor extraction** dismembered **social life** as much as bodies.

### Connections to broader themes

* **Wage vs. coercion:** A key case where **nominal ‚Äúwages‚Äù mask coercion**‚Äîvital for discussing **unfree labor** and **debt peonage**.
* **Nutrition as control:** **Food rationing** operates as **labor discipline**, connecting to modern debates about **workplace health & safety** and **employer control**.
* **Proto-capitalist extraction:** Illustrates how **colonial profits** were built on **hyper-exploitation**‚Äîa template echoed in **modern mineral frontiers**.

## 5) **(Class Slide Deck) ‚Äî ‚ÄúWEEK02\_Introduction to the course‚Äù**

The course slides you shared tie these readings together: Spanish conquest (1538) and **centuries of silver extraction from Cerro Rico (Potos√≠)**; **child labor** as a throughline from **colonial** to **contemporary** Bolivia; and a prompt to craft midterm questions around these themes.&#x20;

### Connections to broader themes

* **Atlantic proletariat:** Slides frame a **multi-origin laboring class** (Indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, indentured Europeans) powering empire‚Äîcontextualizing **Bolivia‚Äôs mines** within **Atlantic-world labor systems**.&#x20;
* **From mita to modern cooperatives:** The slide emphasis on **forced labor (then)** vs. **precarious, often child, labor (now)** encourages a **long-dur√©e** view of extraction‚Äôs social costs.&#x20;

# After-Reading: How Each Source Maps Back to Course-Wide Questions

### ILAB (DOL) ‚Äî Bolivia

* **Policy effectiveness:** What makes **child-labor laws** effective (or not) when **informality** and **poverty** dominate? ([DOL][1])
* **Targeting risk:** Why are **Indigenous children** overrepresented in WFCL, and what **targeted protections** work? ([DOL][2])
* **Global supply chains:** How should **downstream companies** respond to upstream child-labor risk? (Annual reports repeatedly nudge better **due diligence**.) ([Littler Mendelson P.C.][6])

### Texas Law ‚Äî ‚ÄúMountain that Eats Men‚Äù

* **Human rights vs. economics:** When **survival income** depends on children‚Äôs wages, what **rights-respecting** policies can truly **replace** hazardous work? ([Texas Law][4])
* **Structural reform:** Why **education/health** plus **enforcement** is more durable than **cash-only** fixes in breaking the **poverty‚Äìmining loop**. ([Texas Law][5])

### Las Casas ‚Äî *Voices of Freedom* (intro/excerpt)

* **Moral testimony:** How **witness narratives** catalyze **legal reforms** (New Laws, 1542) yet face **implementation limits**‚Äîa pattern we still see in modern labor governance.
* **Imperial narratives:** The **‚ÄúBlack Legend‚Äù** debate helps us read **bias and power** in sources‚Äîa skill for analyzing both **colonial** and **contemporary** labor texts.

### Las Casas ‚Äî ‚ÄúMonk page 7‚Äù

* **Unfree labor spectrum:** Shows how **debt, rations, and ‚Äúwages‚Äù** can produce **coercion without chains**‚Äîuseful for comparing to **modern debt bondage** or **quota systems**.
* **Health & safety:** Early example of **OSH** (occupational safety & health) violations: starvation diets, lethal shifts‚Äîcontinuities with **Cerro Rico today**.

# Activity Questions
---
## 1) Enrique‚Äôs Rebellion and the Temporary Success Against Spanish Conquest

**Q. How did Enrique‚Äôs Rebellion in the early 1500s temporarily succeed in resisting the Spanish conquest of Hispaniola?**
**A.** Enriquillo (Guarocuya), a Ta√≠no cacique, waged a 13-year guerrilla war (1519‚Äì1533) from the Bahoruco mountains that neutralized Spanish cavalry and armor advantages through surprise raids and terrain mastery. He leveraged Ta√≠no networks (and, in accounts, ties with maroons), framed his cause in Christian/legal language noted by Las Casas, and imposed sufficient costs that the Crown negotiated a peace in 1533 recognizing limited lands/freedom‚Äîan implicit admission Spain could not beat him in the hills. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

## 2) Displacement ‚Üí Modern Land Rights & Environmental Justice

**Q. How has the historical displacement of Indigenous communities influenced modern land rights and environmental justice movements in America?**
**A.** Centuries of removals and treaty breaches inform today‚Äôs EJ strategies that insist on **sovereignty and consent** (FPIC) before projects proceed on Native lands. Activists ground claims in the **U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**‚ÄîArticles 10, 19, 29, 32‚Äîrequiring consultation/consent and forbidding forced relocation. These norms now shape litigation, consultation protocols, and coalition politics in fights over pipelines, mining, and water protection. ([United Nations][2])

---

## 3) 500 Nations, Part 2 ‚Äî Who tells the story?

**Q. Why is it important that *500 Nations, Part 2* centers Indigenous people telling their own history, rather than outsiders narrating it?**
**A.** It advances **epistemic justice**: people most affected define the terms, events, and meanings of their histories. This aligns with **UNDRIP Article 16**, recognizing the right to Indigenous media and representation in mainstream media, and with current UNESCO guidance urging states and outlets to reflect Indigenous cultural/linguistic diversity. Centering Native narrators corrects distortions from outsider frames and yields more accurate accounts of governance, land relations, spirituality, and survivance. ([United Nations][3])

**Q. How does hearing directly from Indigenous voices change the way we understand survival, culture, and resilience?**
**A.** First-person testimony repositions Indigenous nations as **agents**‚Äîdecision-makers who adapt institutions, economies, and ceremony to endure colonial pressure‚Äîrather than as passive subjects. It also clarifies present-day policy needs (land back, FPIC, co-management) that third-person narratives often downplay. ([OHCHR][4])

---

## 4) Lessons from Indigenous Sustainability

**Q. What lessons can be learned from the sustainable practices of Indigenous nations, and how can they be applied to global environmental challenges today?**
**A.** Key lessons: **relational stewardship** (responsibility to land/water), community-set limits (rotational harvests, cultural fire), and **consent-based governance** over extraction or infrastructure. Practical application = pairing science with **Indigenous decision power** (FPIC) in co-management agreements, watershed protection, and biodiversity programs‚Äînow recommended across U.N./UNESCO venues. ([United Nations][5])

---

## 5) *The Mountain That Eats Men: Potos√≠ and the Silver Mines* (22 min)

**Q. Analyze the role of global demand for silver and other minerals in perpetuating the conditions in Cerro Rico.**
**A.** Since the 1500s, Potos√≠ sat inside a **world silver circuit** (to Spain and across the Pacific to Asia via Manila galleons). Global demand built an extractive model that externalized local costs (danger, disease) to meet distant market needs; the same price-driven logic still pressures wages/safety in today‚Äôs informal/co-op mines. ([Wikipedia][6])

**Q. How has the history of colonialism shaped the mining practices in this region?**
**A.** Spain institutionalized **forced Andean labor (mita)**, tax/fiscal regimes (e.g., quinto), and mercury-based processing that maximized output while minimizing worker protections‚Äîpatterns of concentrated control and risk that echo in modern small-scale mining at Cerro Rico. ([Wikipedia][6])

**Q. What role can international policies and global initiatives play in promoting ethical labor practices within resource-dependent economies, and how might they address systemic challenges such as economic dependency and regulatory gaps?**
**A.**

* **Labor/child-labor baselines:** Enforce ILO child-labor prohibitions; ILAB‚Äôs Bolivia findings show persistent risks in mining and weak enforcement capacity‚Äîso external financing for inspections, services, and schooling is key. ([DOL][7])
* **Supply-chain leverage:** Require buyers/traders/smelters to implement **OECD mineral due-diligence** (trace, assess, mitigate, remedy), tying market access to compliance. ([OECD][8])
* **Escape the dependency trap:** Pair standards with **diversification, social protection, and education** so communities aren‚Äôt forced back into hazardous mining whenever prices spike (a gap ILAB repeatedly flags). ([DOL][7])

**Q. Does the film allow Indigenous children and families to tell their own stories, or do outsiders mostly tell them? Give examples.**
**A.** Use a scene test: when underground interviews and family dialogues **drive the narrative** (work‚Äìschool trade-offs, health fears, pay), the film centers them; where **voice-of-God narration** or non-local experts explain conditions while miners appear mainly as visuals, it tilts to outsiders. (Either way, UNDRIP Article 16 sets the standard that Indigenous people should control their own media representation.) ([United Nations][3])

---

## 6) *Bolivian Children Mines* (3:45 min)

**Q. How do global market forces, including the demand for metals like silver, influence labor practices and perpetuate child labor in the mining industry, particularly in low-income economies?**
**A.** Price booms increase incentives for **family/child labor** in artisanal and small-scale mines where regulation is thin. ILAB reports for Bolivia document children in **hazardous mining** and enforcement/resource gaps that worsen during commodity upswings. Supply-chain due diligence by downstream buyers is therefore pivotal. ([DOL][7])

**Q. After hearing survivors and authors describe these experiences, who bears responsibility for changing these conditions‚Äîgovernments, corporations, or global consumers? Why?**
**A.** **Shared but differentiated**:

* **Governments** must enforce bans, fund inspections, and provide schooling/food stipends (ILO/UN obligations). ([DOL][9])
* **Corporations & buyers** must map and audit supply chains and finance **remediation** under OECD guidance. ([OECD][10])
* **Consumers/financiers** influence demand for certified, higher-standard minerals and for policies that raise the floor globally.

**Q. If you were one of these miners, what help/support would you hope for from the outside world?**
**A.** **Immediate:** PPE, ventilation, medical screening (silicosis), fairer ore pricing, meal/daycare programs, and school stipends to keep children out of mines. **Structural:** skills training and jobs beyond mining; social protection and community-controlled funds co-financed by the state and mineral buyers (so families aren‚Äôt forced back underground during price shocks). (These address the enforcement and service gaps flagged by ILAB.) ([DOL][7])

# Class Notes:


### Atlantic Proletariat
- Serfdom, indentured servants
  - May have some degrees of freedom [within the constraints of their labor contracts and social hierarchy]
  - Never will have economic freedom [as their labor and earnings were typically controlled by others]
  - Child labor is prominent since needed everyone to work to scrape by [families relied on the contributions of all members to survive in often harsh colonial conditions]
- Social historians argue that many groups of workers provided the labor necessary for colonial expansion in the Atlantic economy. [This labor force was diverse and often exploited, forming the backbone of colonial development.]
- Who were the Atlantic Proletariat?
  - Native Americans [often forced into labor or disposessed of their lands, becoming reliant on colonial economies]
  - English, Scots, Scots Irish Indentured Servants [individuals who agreed to work for a set period in exchange for passage to the colonies, often facing harsh conditions]
  - African people from Ghana [enslaved individuals transported across the Atlantic, subjected to forced labor and brutal treatment]
  - Dispossessed commoners [individuals who lost their land or livelihoods in Europe due to enclosure movements or economic hardship]
  - Transported felons [convicts sent to the colonies as a form of punishment, used as a labor source]
  - Religious radicals [groups persecuted for their beliefs who sought refuge in the colonies and often formed laboring communities]
- **Individuality/Individualism**
    - The concept of individuality, or individualism, refers to the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, or social outlook that emphasizes the moral worth of the individual. It is a philosophical perspective that champions the rights, freedoms, and autonomy of the individual.
    - In the context of the Taino people, the concept of individuality, as understood in Western thought, might differ significantly. Taino society, like many indigenous societies, was often characterized by a strong sense of communalism and interconnectedness. While individuals certainly had distinct roles and identities, their sense of self was often deeply intertwined with their family, clan, and community. Decisions and actions were frequently made with the collective good in mind, and social harmony was highly valued. The imposition of European notions of individualism could have been disruptive to these established social structures and value systems.
- The ones to take land in the New World would be
    - Knights
    - Clergy
    - Landlords
    - Same as in Europe
    - Make a system to take land, create boundaries, and define an economy
    - And then split money
- Right now in Bolivia
    - Mining and child labor controlled by state and private entities (shares and money)
        - COMIBOL (State)
        - Blackrock
        - Glencore
        - Vanguard
        - British Royalties
        - Spain
### Colonial Era
- 1500s-1600s
- Potos√≠, Bolivia = Mountain that eats men
- Under the *mita* and *encomienda* systems, indigenous and enslaved Africans were forced into mines.
    - The *mita* system was a pre-Columbian labor draft system used by the Inca Empire, which was adapted by the Spanish to force indigenous populations into labor, particularly in mines.
    - The *encomienda* system granted Spanish conquistadors and settlers control over specific groups of indigenous people, obligating them to provide labor and tribute in exchange for protection and religious instruction. In practice, this often led to severe exploitation and abuse.
- 12-16 hour shifts underground
- Oxygen-scarce tunnels, toxic mercury exposure
- Starvation, diets of cassava bread and small meat portions
- High death toll -> silver financed the Spanish Empire, which wealth flowed to Europe, not to indigenous families.
- Exploitation rooted in colonial labor systems
- Starvation, diets of cassava bread and small meat portions
- High death toll -> silver financed spanish empire which wealth flowed to europe not to indegnous famiies
- Exploitation rooted in colonial labour systems
